# SOMETHING-3D-Royal-V1.0

This project has been organized because the printer model is very old, and there is no possibility of obtaining an update program or making any adjustments from the manufacturer. We have painstakingly worked to make life easier for the community. This open-source firmware can be modified by the user depending on the equipment variations installed on this model with a different assembly version. Instructions for modifying the settings themselves are available in the comments of the software code.
